## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I added new CSS properties, such as content fit and a new html tag time, to this project.

```html
<time datetime="2023-21-12">Published 21 Dec 2023</time>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  max-width: fit-content;
}
```


### Continued development

This card is very helpful to me because it can be used again in other projects and saves time when making a fresh card of this kind.
